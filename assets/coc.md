Flutter Europe is a community event dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for all participants, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof.

We — the organizers of Flutter Europe — require every participant, including ticket holders, volunteers, partners & partner representatives, service crew members, as well as ourselves, to refrain from the following actions:

- Unwelcome or hostile behaviour, including verbal or written comments that intimidate, create discomfort, or interfere with a person’s participation in the conference.
- Unsolicited physical contact, and deliberate invasion of private space.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Use of sexualized language, images, or clothing. This includes presentations, slides, speaker content, and all materials publicly available or distributed during the event.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Disruption of talks or other events happening at, or in connection with the conference.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the behaviour listed above.

If a participant engages in any of the above, we retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference without refund.

These rules apply to all actions targeted at any participant of the conference, throughout the duration of the conference, including supporting events, regardless of the location of offending actions.
